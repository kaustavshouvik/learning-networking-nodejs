1. The network layers moves packets from point A to point B.
   - Issues which network layer doesn't really address:
     1. Packet retransmitted? Receiver got duplicate packet?
     2. Receiver is down, what happens to the packet?
2. This is where transport layer comes in, where we have protocols such TCP and UPD.
   - TCP make sures that packet is reliably transported.
