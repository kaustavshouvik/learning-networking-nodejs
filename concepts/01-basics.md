1. Every computer has a unique MAC address (48 bits, 8 bits in group of 6).
   - This unique address comes from the netword card.
2. A switch needs to be configured.
   - Each one of the inputs would be configured to a destination MAC address.
   - When a packet arrives to the switch with a destination MAC address, it knows how to route it.
3. Routes work with IP addresses (switches work with MAC addresses).
   - Each router would have unique IP address along with the system whom it is connected to.
